# Spring MVC Project

## Features

The project by default comes with a useful series of features:

- Preconfigured POM to begin developing a new [Spring MVC](https://spring.io) project with [Spring Boot}(https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
- Initial sample project including working persistence and exception handling
- Using [Angular](https://angular.io/) for the UI.

- Unit and integration tests suites ready to be run with [JUnit](http://junit.org) just by using the Maven test and verify commands.

## Documentation

The documentation site is actually a Maven site, and its sources are included in the project. If required it can be generated by using the following Maven command:

```
mvn verify site -P h2,development -Dspring.profiles.active=test,h2
```

The verify phase is required, otherwise some of the reports won't be generated.

## Usage

The application is coded in Java, using Maven to manage the project.

### Profiles

Maven profiles are included for setting up the database.

Spring profiles are also included for the databases. Matching the same name.

| Profile  | Database              |
|----------|-----------------------|
| h2       | H2 in-memory database |
| mysql    | MySQL database        |
| postgres | PostgreSQL database   |

| Profile     | Server                   |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| development | Development settings     |
| production  | Production settings      |

### Installing

The project can be installed by creating the war file and deploying it into a server.

### Running

To run the project locally use the following Maven command:

```
mvn spring-boot:run -P h2,development -Dspring.profiles.active=h2
```

It will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

### Running the tests

The project requires a database and a server for being able to run the integration tests.

Just like running the project, an embedded server with an in-memory database can be used:

```
mvn verify -P h2,development -Dspring.profiles.active=test,h2
```

### Packaging the WAR

When creating the WAR file the database connection credentials should be read from the environment:

```
mvn package -P production,mysql
```
